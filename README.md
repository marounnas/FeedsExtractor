# FeedsExtractor
 - You can click on a Tweet to navigate to its url.
 - To save a filter, click on the keyboard's magnifier after you type your filter in the search bar.
 - In the Filters activity, you can long press on a filter to delete it.
 - I didn't use Retrofit2 to call APIs because no need to add a library for 1 call only.
